# Small-Projects

I've uploaded some small projects I have done in the past, they could either be from my interest in the CS domain, or assignments/projects that I got from school. I tried to comment and make detailed README.md documents so please check them out. I always appreciate advice, and look forward to getting some feedback. Keep on the lookout, more projects to come!
